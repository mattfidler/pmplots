\description{
Make boxplots
}
\details{
Since this function creates a boxplot,
the \code{x} column must be character, factor
or logical and \code{y} column must
be numeric.

If \code{shown} is \code{TRUE}, a numeric summary of each
box is included
below each box.  In the summary, \code{n} is the number of
non-NA observations in the \code{y} column for that box and
\code{N} is the number of unique \code{ID} values for
that box.  An error will be generated if \code{ID} does
not exist in the plotting data frame when \code{shown} is
\code{TRUE}.  When \code{N} is equal to \code{n} in the
summary, only \code{n} is shown.

The summaries will not be correct if the plot is eventually faceted by
another variable in the data set.  In this case, either use
\code{shown=FALSE} or create the plot with \code{\link{split_plot}}.

When the user passes the \code{points} argument, \code{outlier.shape} is
automatically switched to \code{NA} so that outlier points are only plotted
once.  The \code{fill} argument is also set to \code{NA}, so that boxes become
transparent, showing the points.

When the user sets \code{points} to \code{TRUE}, grey points are shown
in back of transparent boxes and the points are jittered in the x-direction.
The user can customize the display of the points by passing a list of
arguments for \code{geom_point} (for example, change the color, transparency,
size, jitter amount, etc).
