# 0.1.0.9001

- Fixed `logbr3` so that the values are sorted; this 
fixes an issue where the grid lines were not propoerly
displayed with these breaks
- Fixed issue in `dv_time` and `dv_pred` when 
modifying the x-scale and y-scale through 
xs and ys arguments
- Changed `dv_time` and `dv_pred` so that 
breaks are at half-log units when `log = TRUE` or 
`loglog = TRUE`


# 0.1.0

- Initial validated version
